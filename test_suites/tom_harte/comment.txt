https://github.com/SingleStepTests/65x02 is huge (~5GB)

what i've tried:
- add it as submodule is very slow
- prepack json's with xz/gz and unpack on each test is slow

what try next:
- since only cycles count is required try to drop "cycles" array, should save a lot of space
- prepack json's with xz/gz and unpack it once with some init test data script
- repack json's to a binary format
